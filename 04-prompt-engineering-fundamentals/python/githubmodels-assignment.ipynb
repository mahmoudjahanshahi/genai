    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "### Lesson Outline\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Warm-Up Discussion (10 minutes)\n",
      "- Begin with a provocative question: \"What would happen if humans colonized Mars? Would we live in total peace, or could conflict arise?\"\n",
      "- Discuss how history has shown that once people expand into new territories (e.g., colonization on Earth), conflicts sometimes follow.\n",
      "- Introduce the idea of the Martian War of 2076 as a thought experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Historical Context & Parallels (15 minutes)\n",
      "- Share examples of Earth-based history that might be analogous to interplanetary tensions:\n",
      "  - Colonial uprisings (American Revolution, Indian independence movement)\n",
      "  - Cold War tensions between superpowers\n",
      "  - Resource-driven conflicts (e.g., wars over gold, oil, or water)\n",
      "- Discuss how conflicts over limited resources, governance, or cultural differences could mirror those situations in a Martian setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Science and Space Exploration (15 minutes)\n",
      "- Provide a short overview of:\n",
      "  - Current Mars exploration programs (NASA, SpaceX, European Space Agency)\n",
      "  - Challenges of living on Mars (limited resources, harsh environmental conditions)\n",
      "  - The potential for cooperation or competition between countries and private corporations in space colonization.\n",
      "- Pose a question: \"How could these factors contribute to a war on Mars in 2076? What might trigger it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Creative Activity: Story or Debate (20 minutes)\n",
      "Choose one of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option A: Collaborative Sci-Fi Storytelling**\n",
      "  - Ask students to work in small groups to create a fictional account of the Martian War of 2076.\n",
      "  - Have them answer key questions: \n",
      "    - What started the war? (resources, ideology, independence?)\n",
      "    - Who were the key players? (Earth nations, Martian colonies, private corporations?)\n",
      "    - What technology or strategies were used?\n",
      "    - What was the resolutionâ€”if any?\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option B: Debate**\n",
      "  - Divide the class into two teams: \n",
      "    - One team represents Martian colonists seeking independence.\n",
      "    - The other team represents Earth-based governments or corporations controlling Marsâ€™ resources.\n",
      "  - Debate prompt: \"Should Martian colonies have the right to self-govern, or does Earth retain control since they funded the colonization?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Homework/Extension:\n",
      "- **Writing Assignment:** Ask students to write a 1-2 page historical account (as if they were living in the 22nd century) reflecting on the causes, events, and outcomes of the Martian War of 2076. Encourage them to include firsthand \"interviews\" with fictional participants, maps, or diary entries.\n",
      "- **Optional Research Task:** Have students investigate current Mars missions and write a report on how feasible colonization really is.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assessment:\n",
      "- Evaluate based on participation in discussions and storytelling/debate activities.\n",

      "\n",
